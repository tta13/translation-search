This PLONK! looks like some comic-sound, does it not? And that is exactly what it is used for. The one who reads it knows he was just added to the killfile of a newsreader; normally this means the recipient of the PLONK! annoyed the sender. The PLONK! is meant to play back the sound of the recipients name hitting the ground in the killfile.

An example. I teach Railway staff how to respond to accidents. I wanted to use a slide to discuss how you can move dangerous loads from a derailed or damaged rail vehicle to a road vehicle after an accident. The slide I made had a simple drawing of tank wagon, the kind used for carrying gases or oils. On the side I wrote Lethal Chemical Company so that I do not have to explain it. I wanted to make several important points. First, you must get any overhead electric wires turned off before you do anything if they are within a certain distance. I drew one of the supporting structures and drew an arrow with the safety distance on it. Then I wanted to say that you must not transfer the wagon's contents in darkness or thunderstorms. I drew a moon and a lightning bolt above the vehicle. You must get specialist advice, so I drew a sheet of paper and wrote the word Plan near the vehicle. You also have to ensure that the vehicle does not move when the weight inside is removed. I drew little red wedges by the wheels. Everything I need to talk about is on this drawing. All I have to do is look at the drawing and it tells me what I need to cover. When I have covered all the things in the drawing, I have finished on that subject.

In the midst of 2000 a full subset of this Super Video CD specification was published as IEC-62107. As the most notable change over Video CD 2.0 is a switch from MPEG-1 CBR to MPEG-2 VBR encoding for the video stream was performed. The following new features--building upon the Video CD 2.0 specification--are: Use of MPEG-2 encoding instead of MPEG-1 for the video stream. Allowed VBR encoding of MPEG-1 audio stream. Higher resolutions (see below) for video stream resolution. Up to 4 overlay graphics and text (""OGT"") sub-channels for user switchable subtitle displaying in addition to the already existing closed caption facility. Command lists for controlling the SVCD virtual machine. For the Super Video CD, only the following two resolutions are supported for motion video and (low resolution) still pictures:480 x 480 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC 2/ 3 D-2).480 x 576 @ 25 Hz (PAL 2/ 3 D-2)."

Even more, with a midi file, you can change individual instruments, change the velocity of a song, & etc; so you have more overall control.

There are several README files in the distribution that explain some of the code's subsystems. If you need ideas of what to work on, see the TODO file. You can submit patches to kstars-devel, and feel free to post any questions you have about the code there as well.

With & kmousetool;, you need to know where you're going to click before you move the mouse in the first place. It is also a good idea to keep your hands off the mouse when you're not using it.

This column shows the IO statistics for each process. The tooltip provides the following information: Characters ReadThe number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage. This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to read() and pread(). It includes things like tty IO and it is unaffected by whether or not actual physical disk IO was required (the read might have been satisfied from pagecache). Characters WrittenThe number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written to disk. Similar caveats apply here as with Characters Read. Read SyscallsThe number of read I/ O operations, i. e. syscalls like read() and pread(). Write SyscallsThe number of write I/ O operations, i. e. syscalls like write() and pwrite(). Actual Bytes ReadThe number of bytes which this process really did cause to be fetched from the storage layer. Done at the submit_bio() level, so it is accurate for block-backed filesystems. This may not give sensible values for NFS and CIFS filesystems. Actual Bytes WrittenAttempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to the storage layer. This is done at page-dirtying time. The number in brackets shows the rate at which each value is changing, determined from taking the difference between the previous value and the new value, and dividing by the update interval. Technical information: This data is collected from / proc/ */ io and is documented further in Documentation/ accounting and Documentation/ filesystems/ proc. txt in the kernel source.

This is helpful if you have problems with the VPN connection.	You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to remove debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are running software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release. If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information at your own risk!

The administrator will tell you which type to use. By default, do use.	A default gateway is a computer which connects two different networks. If you have configured a small network of your own, it is most likely that you want all (or some) of your machines to grant Internet access. But this is not possible directly, because these machines use local private IP-addresses, which are not routed in the Internet. The solution is a computer which translates between the two different networks. This computer uses at least two interfaces. One of them, maybe an Ethernet card, points to the local network, the other one, maybe an ISDN card, points to the Internet. In this case, both interfaces use different IP-addresses. This computer performs a so called network address translation (NAT, aka IP-forwarding). To enable a local machine the Internet access, you have only to tell them the default gateway, the local IP-address of the gateway-computer.

This only works partially if rsync is not running as a system administrator and --super is not specified.	"No hide This option is based on the option of the same name provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is mounted. That filesystem is ""hidden"". Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not to be hidden, and an appropriately authorized client will be able to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing the change. However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode number. The nohide option is currently only effective on single host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports. This option can be very useful in some situations, but it should be used with due care, and only after confirming that the client system copes with the situation effectively."

Vorheriges Stück@action player skip forward	Previous song	This filter rule causes rsync to search for a.rsync-filter file in each directory of the hierarchy to be transferred and to use its filter rules for the transfer if it exists. This filter rule has no effect if you also select the --filter='exclude.rsync-filter' filter rule.	"No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the ""filehandle"" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled."

Rsync is a wonderful little utility that's amazingly easy to set up on your machines. Rather than have a scripted FTP session, or some other form of file transfer script - rsync copies only the differences of files that have actually changed, compressed and through ssh if you want to for security. That's a mouthful.

Wiederholen@action playlist shuffle	Repeat	Do not exceed file system boundaries (-x, --one-file-system), which causes rsync not to exceed file system boundaries during recursive transmission. For more information on this option, read the manual page for rsync.	Rsync is a wonderful little utility that's amazingly easy to set up on your machines.

Beliebige Reihenfolge@action player auto-start	Shuffle	Update only existing files	Show only the existing files
Automatisch starten@action	Auto-Start	Pass the creation of new files on the receiving page (--existing), which causes rsync not to create files (and directories) that do not yet exist on the target page. If this option is combined with the --ignore-existing option, then no files will be updated (which can be useful if they only want to delete foreign files).	Ignoring means that you will not be warned again (unless the disk file changes once more): if you save the document, you will overwrite the file on disk; if you do not save then the disk file (if present) is what you have.

Clearing the log discards any previous log window contents. If you are unsure about whether you'll need the current contents afterwards, you should save them to a file (see above) before clearing.
Helikopter@item:inlistbox	Helicopter	Delayed updates to the end of the transfer	Finishing later than late finish
Applaus@item:inlistbox	Applause	Delay the update until the end of the transfer (--delay-updates). This option causes the updated files to be temporarily stored in a separate directory until the end of the transfer and then renamed and moved to their place.	(which is & eg; used by the menu item Advanced Update to Tag/ Date...). In such a case, the tag on the file gets sticky, & ie; further updates do not bring you to the newest revision on the branch. If you want to commit further revisions to the branch, you have to update to the branch tag before you do further commits.

You can use the --backup-dir=DIR and --suffix=SUFFIX options to check where the backups are stored and which suffixes are attached to them.	You could run. / configure --prefix=/ usr to specify the prefix that you prefer and then try make and make install again.

Zurückspulen@info:whatsthis	Rewind	The reconciliation of an account ensures that your records are consistent with your bank's records and that there are no errors on either side. You should synchronize your account with each receipt of an account statement. All information relevant to this process is usually derived from your account statement. On the next page, make sure that the opening and closing balances in KMyMoney match those in the account statement.	Reconciliation is the process of matching the transactions you have entered into & kappname; with the transactions listed for that account by the institution. This is most commonly done with the list of transactions in a statement, be it a bank statement, credit card statement, loan statement, or any other statement. It can also be done against an on-line listing of the account, although this is less common. If any discrepancies are found, then either you or the person who created the statement have made a mistake.

The borrower makes a periodic payment to the lender. The periodic payment is the sum of the principal payment (which is used to pay down the balance of the loan) plus the interest payment (which rewards the lender for allowing the use of the money by the borrower) plus any recurring fees (which cover any incidentals.) At the end of the loan, the borrower has paid back the entire principal.

Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas	Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas	KMyMoney will create a payment plan and will remind you when you are in a position to do so. Please select the account to/from which payments will be made and the category to which the interest payments will be assigned. This date has already been recorded if you have selected all payments. If you have selected payments since the beginning of this year, the first due date is the date on which the first payment was made this year.	By default, this shows the start date of the current month or billing period. If you change the date, KNemo will recalculate billing periods from that date forward. Any billing periods before that date will remain unmodified. If you set an erroneous date, just select an earlier good billing date, and KNemo will repair it.
Zu öffnende Stücke@info	Song(s) to open	The category that is assigned to the interest portion of the payments. If you take a loan, you usually pay interest, so this should be an expenditure category. If you lend money, then you get the interest. In this case, choose a revenue category.	The interest field is for interest you gained. If you have to pay interest, & eg;, for a credit card account, this has to be entered as a charge.
Es ist kein MIDI-Modul geladen.@title:window	No MIDI backend loaded.	Choose the account from which you make or receive periodic payments if you lend money. This is usually a current account.	If you borrowed or lent cash select the account from which or to which the loan amount was paid.
Schwerwiegender Fehler@info:whatsthis	Fatal	Now enter the details for this loan. If you leave one of the fields blank, KMyMoney will calculate it if you choose Calculate. Before you can proceed, you must press Calculate so that KMyMoney can check the logical correctness of the values you specify.	Finally, use the Calculate button to check the values you have entered. You must have entered either all or all but one of the values listed above. If you omit two or more values the button is disabled because it is not possible to check that the entered values are consistent: in that case you will not be able to use the Loan account facility in & kappname; and will instead have to use a Liability or Asset account to track the loan manually.

In this case, please enter the balance sheet of your last settlement.	"The next three items are for handling Loans on which you've already made payments. If you select Yes in the ""Have you made/ received any payments yet?"" item you can then select whether you want to record all payments or just those from the beginning of the current year. If you want to record from the beginning of the current year, you are than asked to input the current balance."

You can disable this security feature by deactivating the option ""No balance as long as the screen saver is running"" on the Quick Balance page in the Settings dialog."	"Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the ""Require password"" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's ""Lock Session"" action."

Click on an entry to set it up. All matching modules marked as active in this list will run during a Quick Reconciliation.	Profile Dumps This dockable shows in the top part the list of loadable profile dumps in all subdirectories of: current working directory of KCachegrind, i. e. where it was started from, and the default profile dump directory given in the configuration. The list is sorted according to the target command profiled in the corresponding dump. On selecting a profile dump, information for it is shown in the bottom area of the dockable: Options allows you to view the profiled command and profile options of this dump. By changing any item, a new (yet unexisting) profile template is created. Press Run Profile to start a profile run with these options in the background. Info gives detailed info on the selected dump like event cost summary and properties of the simulated cache. State is only available for current happening profiles runs. Press Update to see different counters of the run, and a stack trace of the current position in the program profiled. Check the Every option to let KCachegrind regularly poll these data. Check the Sync option to let the dockable activate the top function in the current loaded dump.

Once a plugin is checked, the Configure button is enabled and you can click it in order to configure the highlighted plugin.
Pause@info:whatsthis	Pause	The general part of the KPilot setup contains the settings for the hardware and the mode of display for various data. The basic setting covers most needs and is set with the help of the setup wizard. Special settings can be made in this dialog. Please note: The quick matching settings are not trivial. An action or a matching module is activated with a click on the selection box. Activated balancing modules are called during a quick matching. Select a balancing module to set it up.	Configuring key bindings is pretty easy. In the middle of these & systemsettings; modules you will find a list of available actions. If there's a key binding configured for that action you will find it in the columns right to it. Just select the action you want to configure.

If on the other hand you installed KPhotoAlbum from a binary package, please tell whoever made the package about this defect, eventually including the information from the section below. In case you are missing a feature and you did not compile KPhotoAlbum yourself, please do consider doing so. It really is n't that hard. If you need help compiling KPhotoAlbum, feel free to ask on the KPhotoAlbum mailing listThe steps to compile KPhotoAlbum can be seen on the KPhotoAlbum home page.

Note that there is currently no feature in & kmail; that allows you to convert between both formats automatically, but you can just move all messages from an old mbox folder to a new maildir folder or vice-versa.

Therefore, you have the option to continue working with unmatched files or discard the changes in any of the files. Select this setting so that KPilot does not overwrite your changes.	You can only run one instance of & kmail; at once. We also recommend to stick to a certain version and not switch back and forth between different versions. Downgrading to an older version will probably cause problems, & eg; because the index file formats might have changed. Upgrading should never be a problem.

Select this setting to choose the correct variant in case of conflict in the conflict resolution dialog.	It sometimes happens that people edit a file at the same time. In this situation it is likely that people will make changes in the document at exactly the same line. This creates a problem because, without applied caution, people could be overwriting each others work as they apply the diff files they receive. Fortunately the developers of the diff and patch programs took this into consideration and so these tools will not allow such changes to be applied without manual intervention. When this state is reached, it is known as a & quot; conflictquot;. & kompare; will display conflicts so that you can manually resolve them, deciding which changes should be applied to which file.

If your system uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), which is normal with recent & Linux; and & Solaris; systems, you should check that your PAM configuration permits login through the service named kde.

The function is similar to in drawing programs: Select a tool for editing the regular expression and press the mouse button in the workspace where you want to insert an element. To get a more detailed description of the functions, please use the corresponding help pages. What is a regular expression? If you do not know what a regular expression is, you should read the introduction to regular expressions.	At the top is a drop down box to enable you to choose which toolbar you want to modify. In the picture the Format toolbar is selected. If I want to add the Spelling icon to that toolbar, I click the entry in the left window. The arrow pointing right becomes available, if I click the arrow the Spelling entry is added to the selected toolbar. The left arrow is available when you click in the right side window. It allows you to remove an icon from a toolbar. The up and down arrows become active when an item on the right side is selected. You can also move the highlight in the right side window up and down with the keyboard arrow keys. By clicking on the arrows with the mouse you can change the order of the entries in the menu.

Located at the left of the editing area is a list box containing user defined regular expressions. Some regular expressions are pre-installed with your & kde; installation, while others you can save yourself.

Telefon@item:inlistbox	Telephone	The text in this window shows which areas are selected by the regular expression. The sections found are colored alternately red and blue to give a better overview. If a part of a regular expression is selected in the editor window, this part is highlighted. This allows a simple debugging of regular expressions.	"Left of each text is the ""summary column"". If differences occurred on a line then the summary column shows the respective color. For a white-space-only difference the summary is chequered. For programming languages where white space is not so important this is useful to see at one glance if anything of importance was modified. (In C/ C++ white space is only interesting within strings, comments, for the preprocessor, and some only very esoteric situations.)"

Gewehrschuss@item:inlistbox	Gunshot	Here is the regular expression in ASCII syntax. This is of particular interest to developers who need to create a regular expression, e.g. for QRegExp. Regular expressions can be defined with both the graphical editor and by direct input in this window.	The regular expression editor is an editor for editing regular expression in a graphical style (in contrast to the ASCII syntax). Traditionally regular expressions have been typed in the ASCII syntax, which for example looks like ^. *kde\\b. The major drawbacks of this style are:

For example, you can specify that the element has to be found two to four times, exactly five times or at least once. Examples: If you specify that it should be found as often as you like and the surrounding text is abc, this element will find the empty string, abc, abcabc, abcabcabc, etc.	Enter the regular expression you want to search for here. Possible meta characters are:. - Matches any character ^ - Matches the beginning of a line $- Matches the end of a line \\lt; - Matches the beginning of a word \\gt; - Matches the end of a word The following repetition operators exist:? - The preceding item is matched at most once * - The preceding item is matched zero or more times + - The preceding item is matched one or more times {n} - The preceding item is matched exactly n times {n,} - The preceding item is matched n or more times {, n} - The preceding item is matched at most n times {n, m} - The preceding item is matched at least n, but at most m times. Furthermore, backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are available via the notation\\ n.

Vorheriges Stück@action player skip forward	Previous song	This element of a regular expression serves two purposes: It allows you to reduce a large element of a regular expression to a small window. This allows you to maintain a better overview of large expressions. In particular, it also helps if you want to load regular expressions from a file and not take care of their internal functioning.	Users with many fonts may find it useful to only have certain fonts enabled (or active) at certain times. To facilitate this, this module will allow you to disable individual fonts, or whole groups of fonts. Disabling a font does not remove the font from the system, it simply hides it so that it no longer appears within applications. Re-enabling a font will then allow it to be used.

For each file found, it is checked whether there is a corresponding file with the.desktop extension, & eg; for uppercase.js the uppercase.desktop file.	& kde; and & kde; applications look up files by scanning all the & kde; directory trees. The directory trees are checked in order of precedence. When a file is present in multiple directory trees, the file from the last tree takes precedence. Normally, the tree located in the user's home directory has the highest precedence. This is also the directory tree to which changes are written.

Now that we have finished the script, we should save it to disk. Press the Save Script button. This will first open a window in which you can provide a name for the script, and fill in your name as the author. Enter Tracking the Moon for a name, and your name as the author, and press OK. Next, you will see the standard & kde; Save File dialog. Specify a filename for the script and press OK to save the script. Note that if your filename does not end with. kstars, this suffix will be automatically attached. If you are curious, you can examine the script file with any text editor.

Running bleeding-edge software means you are running software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release. If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information at your own risk!

Furthermore, the calls are displayed in/from the function within a profile file. After changing the selection of one or more profile files, the costs are always related to the selected files everywhere in KCachegrind. If no part has been selected, all files are implicitly treated as selected. This list supports multiple selection. You can select areas by dragging the mouse or using Shift/Ctrl Shift keys. Selecting and selecting files is also possible via this window. This list is not displayed if only one profile file is loaded.	Trace Part List This list shows all trace parts of the loaded trace. For each part, the self/ inclusive cost of the current selected function, spent in the part, is shown; percentage costs are always relative to the total cost of the part (not to the whole trace as in the Trace Part Overview). Also shown are the calls happening to/ from the current function inside of the trace part. By choosing one or more trace parts from the list, the costs shown all over KCachegrind will only be the ones spent in the selected part(s). If no list selection is shown, in fact all trace parts are selected implicitly. This is a multi-selection list. You can select ranges by dragging the mouse or use SHIFT/ CTRL modifiers. Selection/ Deselection of trace parts can also be done by using the Trace Part Overview Dockable. This one also supports multiple selection. Note that the list is hidden if only one trace part is loaded.

After confirming your selection with the OK button, a short info will be displayed with the times of the selected time zones as soon as you move the mouse over the clock.

The right-most & plasmoid; in the default panel holds the Digital Clock. This clock can display the time in different timezones as well as have its size changed. The clock will adjust its font size to the area it is given by the surrounding containment (that is the panel in this case). If you choose to display the date, this date will be rendered using the Small font option from the & systemsettings; Font dialog. The time will take the rest of the space. So in the end, you'll choose yourself the amount of information displayed, and if that fits. If you want to display more information, make the panel larger or put the clock on the desktop where it can grow freely.
